      <h4> PROJECT OVERVIEW </h4>
      <p> We want to take a look at what about XR in gaming excites people, what makes people want to experience it, and what the path forward looks like in improving and creating a more immersive experience. Our research also will synthesize pain points in current VR systems and their possible solutions. </p>



<div class="row">
        <h4> RESEARCH </h4>
        <p> Our approach was to look into the current state of VR and gaming, and to understand the background surrounding the two.</p>

    <h4> OUR PROBLEMS </h4>
    <h5> There's a noteworthy GAP between new and experienced VR gamers. </h5>
    <h5> VR is an underdeveloped field both in terms of software and hardware. </h5>
    <h5> Player comfort/User Experience does not have enough of a focus. </h5>
    <h5> The immersive capabilities of VR are underutilized. </h5>
</div>

    <h4> HOW MIGHT WE... </h4>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <h4> OUR PERSONA </h4>
    <div class="column">
        <p> Our Persona, Benson, was an average PC Gamer from California. We chose Benson as our persona so we could target his pain points that are keeping him from buying a VR. </p>
        <p> Addressing Benson's issues will allow more inclined VR gamers a larger incentive to play, as users who regularly play videogames are more enticed to purchase a VR along with their consoles. </p>
        <p> Focusing on these issues allowed us to target the overall UX experience for a more sustainable future in VR. </p>

    </div>

<div class="row">
    <h4> OUR OUTCOMES </h4>
    <h5> Adressing Overall User Experience and Comfort </h5>
    <p> <b> Firstly, we must take into account that VR is still in its beginning stages. </b> Being said, this provides much potential for users. In order to improve retention and playability, designers should focus on enchancing and improving VR's UI for easier and more intuitive navigation. Either in the physical plane with headset weight and overall comfort, and in the digital landscape with its navigational elements, VR Devices need to create more intuitive and understandable methods in order to be a true competitor to gaming systems. </p>
