      <h4> PROJECT OVERVIEW </h4>
      <p> Golden Gate Park withholds numerous amount of events that go on throughout its location. Expanding more than 3 miles east to west, this historical landmark crowns itself as the 3rd most visited park in the United States. On the month of October, the park held 18 events that went on throughout its respective sub-locations. In order to advertise the vast amount of celebrations that went forth, an event poster was illustrated to showcase the dates, times, and locations of the events that went on in the Month. <b> Using abstract shape and type, the goal of this project was to create a strong composition while still adhering to Golden Gate Parkâ€™s identity and brand. </b> </p>

      <h4> ABSTRACT </h4>
      <p> The chaos of geometric shapes, triangular slice along the title, vertical typography, and mountainous reflection were utilized to emphasize the definition of fall. Set times were added at the end of each description to allow the reader to read seamlessly through the dated events. Orphans and widows were also taken into account among the iterations </p>
